## Group Discussion

  ### Questions & Resonses
      - What was the most challenging aspect of this project?

      - What was the most exciting aspect of this project?

      - Describe the best choice enumerables you used in your project. (Please include file names and line numbers.)

      - Tell us about a module or superclass which helped you re-use code across repository classes. 
          - Why did you choose to use a superclass and/or a module?

      - Tell us about:
          1) a unit test and 
          2) an integration test that you are particularly proud of. Please include file name(s) and line number(s).

      - Is there anything else you would like instructors to know?


  ### Q & A
      (Include a minimum of 1 question from each group memember. Instructiosn will answer these during their feedback video.)



## Evaluation Readiness Checklist 
  ### Demonstration of Functional Completeness
      - Display to the viewer the ability to start the program via the runner file, and demonstrate a few of the statistics that can be calculated.


  ### Technical Quality & Organization of the Code
      - At a high level (not line by line), describe how you broke out this application. 
          - What classes did you create? 
          - What is the responsibility of each class? 
          - Why did you choose to design your code in this way?

      - Is there a design decision that you made that youâ€™re particularly proud of?

      - Did you use inheritence and/or modules in your project? Why did you choose to use one over the other?

      - Were you able to implement a hash at some point in your project? If so, where? And why did you choose to use a hash instead of another data type?


  ### Identifying Areas of Code that you Decided to Refactor
      - How did you identify areas of code to refactor? 
          - At a high level, how did you go about refactoring?

      - Are there other areas of your code that you still wish to refactor?


  ### Discussion of Collaboration/Version Control
      - What was your collaboration like in this group project? 
          - How was it different working in a larger group compared to pairs?

      - Were there any tools that you used to make collaboration easier?


  ### Discussion of Test Coverage
      - Run your test suite and open the coverage report from SimpleCov.

      - Show examples of unit and integration tests that you wrote.

      - Run the Spec Harness.

      - What was it like using the Spec Harness for this project? How did it inform your design or testing choices?
