  ### Questions & Resonses
      - What was the most challenging aspect of this project?
        **Hady:** 
        **Dawson:** Understanding theory behind inheritance and how that differs from modules. Building out each of those file types and working through them slowly with my teammmates added in my understanding. 
        **Mel:** Trying to build every method inside of one class was VERY difficult. Then, attempting to separate the different methods out and have them able to pass a test now that it was in a new location. 

      - What was the most exciting aspect of this project?
        Hady: 
        Dawson: Observing how the creation of helper methods for the more complex methods dryed up our code as well as implementing modules to further clean it up. Seeing how these two interacted with each other to improve readbility was the most interesting aspect for me. 
        Mel: Diagraming out how each file was connected was very helpful is visualizing the structure of the project we were trying to build. Learning that the speed of code depended greatly upon how many times the CSV data was accessed/iterated over was very interesting to me. This lead to the refactoring of many different methods (some I wrote and other's I did not) to try and utilize the method that included the memoized data in a effort to reduct CSV hits. 


      **- Describe the best choice enumerables you used in your project. (Please include file names and line numbers.)**
        Hady: 
        Dawson: < goals_utility.rb : line 4 >
        Initially adopted the, "when in doubt use <.each>" mindset. But once I got to refactoring, I was able to create an array more effectively with <.map>.
        Mel: < season_utility.rb : line 4 >
        Most of the methods I wrote still use only <.each> with an acculumator. However, while refactoring the use of memoized methods, I was able to use <.group_by> to produce a hash more efficiently.


      **- Tell us about a module or superclass which helped you re-use code across repository classes.**
        **- Why did you choose to use a superclass and/or a module?**

        Our project includes a superclass called stats.rb that includes states we wanted to pass to each subclass. These states is how we were able to reach into the CSV data files and parse out the data into the way we desired to use it, ie. an array of key-value pairs with the keys being the header info and the value being a hash of objects. These three attributes were then passed to all subclasses.

        We chose this route to simplify the process of dividing out which subclasses needed access to which CSV files. We chose to give all subclasses access to all CSV data.


      **- Tell us about:**
          1) a unit test and 
          2) an integration test that you are particularly proud of. Please include file name(s) and line number(s).

      - Is there anything else you would like instructors to know?

  ### Q & A
      (Include a minimum of 1 question from each group memember. Instructions will answer these during their feedback video.)
        Hady: 
        Dawson: Does the way we set up the modules reflect the single responsibility priciple, or is it smelly code? When we memoized information for some module methods, the speed of our code actually reduced - was this implemented incorrectly? 
        Mel: Is there a more efficient way to parse the CSV data and deliver it to the desired classes? How can we mose effective use/call on memoized data to increase run speed? 



## Evaluation Readiness Checklist 
  ### Demonstration of Functional Completeness
      [x] Display to the viewer the ability to start the program via the runner file, and demonstrate a few of the statistics that can be calculated.


  ### Technical Quality & Organization of the Code
      - At a high level (not line by line), describe how you broke out this application. 
          - What classes did you create? 
          - What is the responsibility of each class? 
            <game.rb, team.rb, gameteam.rb>
                Three classes created objects from each line of the CSV data.
            <game_stats.rb, league_stats.rb, season_stats.rb, team_stats.rb>
                Four subclasses that housed the logic.
            <stats.rb>
                One superclass to parse out CSV data and deliver that to the subclasses.
            <stat_tracker.rb>
                One class to call upon all required methods.

        - Why did you choose to design your code in this way?
            The stat_tracker class was required. We decided to use inheritance/a superclass since we wanted to pass states to the subclasses. This allows all the subclasses to have all the same attributes. While working in different subclass files, we did not have to worry about only having partial access to the CSV data. 
            
            Following the DRY principle, we reviewed the methods is the different subclasses and identified which methods utilized the same helper methods. Then, by following the Law of Demeter, those similar methods were moved into modules with similar utility. As a result, this increases readability to hopefully achieve developer empathy.
        
      - Is there a design decision that you made that youâ€™re particularly proud of?
        During It.2, we decided to organize all methods in the same order as the statistics page. Only the def/end + method name was written, separated by lines of ###'s. This small design choice helped us mitigate merge conflicts since we were all working on different methods but within the same file. 

      - Did you use inheritence and/or modules in your project? Why did you choose to use one over the other?

      - Were you able to implement a hash at some point in your project? If so, where? And why did you choose to use a hash instead of another data type?


  ### Identifying Areas of Code that you Decided to Refactor
      - How did you identify areas of code to refactor? 
          - At a high level, how did you go about refactoring?

      - Are there other areas of your code that you still wish to refactor?


  ### Discussion of Collaboration/Version Control
      - What was your collaboration like in this group project? 
          - How was it different working in a larger group compared to pairs?

      - Were there any tools that you used to make collaboration easier?


  ### Discussion of Test Coverage
      - Run your test suite and open the coverage report from SimpleCov.

      - Show examples of unit and integration tests that you wrote.

      - Run the Spec Harness.

      - What was it like using the Spec Harness for this project? How did it inform your design or testing choices?
